# Creating Stations

There are multiple ways that a new station can be added: drag-and-drop, clicking `New Station`, synchronizing from the game's radios folder, clicking `New Station`, and clicking `New Station > From .zip file...`. However, for the sake of this *Quick Guide*, we'll focus on the default way to create a new station.

Click the `New Station` button. The new station will appear in the left pane as `69.9 [New Station]`. Every new station you create will have an incrementing number after the station name.

The right pane will update with the station's properties. This is where the majority of the customization takes place.

The `Display and Icon` tab contains properties related to how the station will appear and function in game.

The `Music` tab contains properties related to the audio for the station whether using a web stream or song files.

# Removing Stations

To remove a radio station, make sure it is selected in the `Stations` list and click the `Delete Station` button at the bottom left.

> [!WARNING]
> There is no warning that you're deleting a station; it will simply just disappear 💨
> 
> If you haven't [exported](export.md) the station yet to the staging folder, then it's gone for good. Otherwise, you can click `File > Stations > Reload From Staging` to re-read the staging folder and bring it back (minus whatever changes you've made).
