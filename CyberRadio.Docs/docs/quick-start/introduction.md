# Introduction

Cyber Radio Assistant (CRA) is run as a standalone application; no installation is required. There are however a few prerequisites that you should have in place before using the tool:

- Cyberpunk 2077 Game
- [radioExt](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4591) mod (and all of its dependencies)

#### Optional Requirements

- Some downloaded radio stations from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/)
- A basic understanding of `JSON` so you can edit the files if needed. **Though, by using this tool, you shouldn't need to** üòâ

# Navigating This Guide

The guide is broken up into small articles each covering a specific topic. The navigation to the left provides links to all of the articles in the guide.

Each page may also contain links to external supplemental resources that help with understanding the topics.

The first thing you should view is the [getting started](getting-started.md) guide. This guide will help get you set up with using CRA and cover some of the fundamentals.

Of course, I'm not your boss and you can navigate these docs however you want üòÅ.
