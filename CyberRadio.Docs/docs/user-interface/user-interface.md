# User Interface

The UI is split into two main parts:
- The left pane (or the stations list box) is a list of stations that currently reside in your staging path.
- The right pane (or the station's properties) is a dynamic pane that will update based on the selected station. *You may have already noticed that if you have no stations, this pane reflects that!*

These two panes are seperated by a split-bar. This means you can resize each pane by hovering between them until the splitter cursor appears, ↔️, and dragging left or right.

The station's properties pane also contains tabs to seperate the display properties from the audio properties.

## Resizing

The main window of the application allows for maximizing and resizing by dragging from one of the corners manually. The application will remember its size on subsequent runs.
