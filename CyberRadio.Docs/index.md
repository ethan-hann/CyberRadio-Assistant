# Welcome to Cyber Radio Assistant! ðŸ“»

Cyber Radio Assistant is a standalone tool that helps you create and manage custom radio stations for the Cyberpunk 2077 mod, [radioExt](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4591).

A brief list of features are below:

- Create custom radio stations in a GUI application instead of by editing a `metadata.json` file.
- Manipulate radio stations downloaded from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/).
- Add/delete songs from the radio station (even ones downloaded from Nexus).
- Export to a staging folder first so the game directory doesn't get messed up.
- Add a web stream for the audio instead of songs and preview the audio directly from the application.
- Localization for English, Spanish, and French. More localizations can be added by cloning the GitHub and submitting a pull request.

This documentation has two parts:
1) a [full guide](docs/introduction.md) that goes over how to use Cyber Radio Assistant ðŸ“ƒ
2) an [API reference](api/RadioExt_Helper.forms.yml) that is useful if you want to see the classes and methods behind the scenes ðŸ˜„

Also, check the VirusTotal report. There were 2 detections out of 71 but both are false positives. If you don't believe me, look through the [source code](https://github.com/ethan-hann/CyberRadio-Assistant) and tell me where the virus is.
