# Welcome to Cyber Radio Assistant! üìª

Cyber Radio Assistant is a standalone tool that helps you create and manage custom radio stations for the Cyberpunk 2077 mod, [radioExt](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4591).

A brief list of features are below:

- **Create custom radio stations** using a GUI application instead of editing a `metadata.json` file.
- **Manage radio stations** downloaded from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/), with options to modify their metadata or playlist.
- **Add and delete songs** from your station, including songs from NexusMods.
- **Export stations to a staging folder** to avoid affecting your game directory directly.
- **Add a web stream** as a radio station instead of local audio files, and preview the stream from within the app.
- **Create and manage custom icons** for your stations, including integration with [Wolven Icon Generator (WIG)](https://github.com/ethan-hann/WolvenIconGenerator) for `.archive` file creation.
- **Localization** support for multiple languages, including English, Espa√±ol, Fran√ßais, Deutsch, Italiano, Portugu√™s, –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, and ‰∏≠Êñá.
- **Asynchronous task support** for background operations like icon generation, with progress tracking and cancellation.
- **User-friendly interface** with a clean and intuitive UI with drag-and-drop functionality for adding songs and icons. Detailed tooltips and user guidance simplify station setup and management.

This documentation has two parts:
1) A [**full guide**](docs/quick-start/introduction.md) that goes over how to use Cyber Radio Assistant üìÉ
2) An [**API reference**](api/RadioExt_Helper.forms.yml) that is useful if you want to see the classes and methods behind the scenes üòÑ

## Documentation Language Support
Currently, `docfx` does not provide a nice way to generate multi-language documentation, so these docs only support English.

  <summary><b>VirusTotal Report</b></summary>

Since you should never run `.exe` files from people you don't trust, I urge you to verify the hash of the file you downloaded against the below.

Also, check the VirusTotal report. There was 1 detection out of 70 but it is a false positive. If you don't believe me, look through the [source code](https://github.com/ethan-hann/CyberRadio-Assistant) and tell me where the virus is.
