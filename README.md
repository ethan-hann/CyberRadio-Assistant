# Welcome to Cyber Radio Assistant! üìª

Cyber Radio Assistant is a standalone tool that helps you create and manage custom radio stations for the Cyberpunk 2077 mod, [radioExt](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4591).

A brief list of features are below:

- **Create custom radio stations** using a GUI application instead of editing a `metadata.json` file.
- **Manage radio stations** downloaded from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/), with options to modify their metadata or playlist.
- **Add and delete songs** from your station, including songs from NexusMods.
- **Export stations to a staging folder** to avoid affecting your game directory directly.
- **Add a web stream** as a radio station instead of local audio files, and preview the stream from within the app.
- **Create and manage custom icons** for your stations, including integration with [Wolven Icon Generator (WIG)](https://github.com/ethan-hann/WolvenIconGenerator) for `.archive` file creation.
- **Localization** support for multiple languages, including English, Espa√±ol, Fran√ßais, Deutsch, Italiano, Portugu√™s, –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, and ‰∏≠Êñá. More localizations can be added by following the steps [here](https://ethan-hann.github.io/CyberRadio-Assistant/docs/advanced-topics/localization.html).
- **Asynchronous task support** for background operations like icon generation, with progress tracking and cancellation.
- **User-friendly interface** with a clean and intuitive UI with drag-and-drop functionality for adding songs and icons. Detailed tooltips and user guidance simplify station setup and management.
