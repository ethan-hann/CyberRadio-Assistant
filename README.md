# Welcome to Cyber Radio Assistant! ðŸ“»

Cyber Radio Assistant is a standalone tool that helps you create and manage custom radio stations for the Cyberpunk 2077 mod, [radioExt](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4591).

A brief list of features are below:

- Create custom radio stations in a GUI application instead of by editing a `metadata.json` file.
- Manipulate radio stations downloaded from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/).
- Add/delete songs from the radio station (even ones downloaded from Nexus).
- Export to a staging folder first so the game directory doesn't get messed up.
- Add a web stream for the audio instead of songs and preview the audio directly from the application.
- Localization for English, Spanish, and French. More localizations can be added by cloning the GitHub and submitting a pull request.
